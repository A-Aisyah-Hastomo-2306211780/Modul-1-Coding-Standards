In the execution of module 1, there are mainly three clean code principles that are applied.
All variables, functions, and others was named with words that represents its intent, for example, the class Product has productId, productName, and productQuantity as its fields.
Every function only does the minimum job and are composed of roughly five or less lines.
The object Product has its fields private with getter and setter. ProductService has abstract interface to be implemented.
Meanwhile the code doesn't really do well in context of secure coding, there are no identification, data validation, nor authentication implemented.
